# QR Code Generator

This Python script generates a QR code from the provided data and saves it as an image file.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install qrcode numpy
   ```

2. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python generate_qr_code.py
   ```

3. The script will generate a QR code image file named `site_inversed.png` in the current directory.

## Example

Consider the following data:

```python
data = "site link"
```

This data will be encoded into a QR code and saved as `site_inversed.png`.

## Requirements

# QR Code Reader

This Python script reads a QR code from an image file and displays the decoded data along with the bounding box of the QR code.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- qrcode
- numpy

You can install them using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python qrcode numpy
```

## Usage

To use this script, run it from the command line with the filename of the image containing the QR code as an argument. For example:

```
python qr_code_reader.py qr_code_image.png
```

The script will display the QR code image with the decoded data and the bounding box of the QR code.

## Example

Suppose you have an image file named `qr_code_image.png` containing a QR code. You can run the script as follows:

```
python qr_code_reader.py qr_code_image.png
```

This will display the QR code image with the decoded data and the bounding box of the QR code.
